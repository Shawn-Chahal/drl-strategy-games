# Deep Reinforcement Learning Strategy Games 
This repository trains the model for the [Connect Four](https://shawnchahal.com/connect-four) web app. The AI employs deep reinforcement learning and was trained entirely through self play using TensorFlow in Python. Based on the AlphaZero algorithm, but made light weight to run on single GPU computers.
